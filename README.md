üìù Project Description
This repository contains the solution for Task 4: Optimization Model as part of the CodTech Internship.
The main objective of this task was to solve a real-world Production Planning problem using Linear Programming (LP) with the Python library PuLP.

The goal is to maximize profit for two products (A and B) given constraints on labor and raw materials.
The project includes a Jupyter Notebook with problem formulation, optimization, visualization of feasible regions, and business insights.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
‚úÖ 1. Problem Formulation: Defined objective function, decision variables, and constraints.

Products: A and B

Profits: $40 (A), $30 (B)

Resources: 100 labor hours, 80 material units

‚úÖ 2. Model Implementation: Built an LP model using the PuLP library.

Objective: Maximize total profit

Constraints:
